# Summary

In the Anet A6 kit the 40mm fan is bolted against the cooling rib to keep the filament assembly drive together. This is done without no support for the fan.

I made this spacer/standoff design to give proper support for the 40mm cooling fan and make the assembly more rigid. To make assembly easier the two spacers is interconnected with a bridge with correct spacing, just insert it into the cooling rib as shown on the photos.
